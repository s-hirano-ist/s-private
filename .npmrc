# Security: Pin exact versions to prevent unexpected updates

# Security: Disable lifecycle scripts for external dependencies to prevent malicious code execution
# This ensures external packages cannot execute arbitrary code during installation
# Our workspace packages' pre/post scripts will still run (e.g., postinstall for Prisma)

# Security: Use frozen lockfile in CI/CD
# This is enforced in CI but not locally to allow updates
# Use --frozen-lockfile flag in CI/CD pipelines

# Security: Set minimal release age (7 days) to avoid newly published packages
# This helps mitigate supply chain attacks via newly published malicious packages
# Note: This feature is supported by some package managers like Socket.dev
